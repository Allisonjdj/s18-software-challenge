# S18 Software Challenge
Once upon a time you were a Waterloo Student. You were living a nice life talking about geese all day, eating at Lazeez and thinking about why youâ€™re getting 60s in your courses. Too bad those days are gone ðŸ˜ž Our world has run out of resources and there is no electricity. You and your friends are sent to Planet X to grab a battery so powerful that it can power the world for a billion years. You arrived at the planet but your pod randomly ran out of battery and you estimate that the battery is 30 Km away from your location. You are unable to walk the 30km due to dangerous aliens and the battery being too heavy to carry back. You will have to find a way to travel 30 km so that you can pick up the battery, charge your pod, and finally provide electricity to planet earth. You look around and see a Hyperloop tube with an old Hyperloop pod in it. You guys are lucky and the tube is fully functional but there is one caveat. The Hyperloop pod inside the tube has not been programmed yet and hence cannot function. You will have to program the pod and make it function so that you can get the battery and come back home!! You find a manual describing the pod hardware and details on how to create the software system. Read through the manual and get to work; The world is relying on you!!!

# General

Programming PodX is a big project and hence you have decided to split it into three components: Embedded, Communication/Backend, and Controls Dashboard. You will work as a group in three separate teams and work on each individual component separately. You will then come together and assemble all the components to test if your system works.

# Embedded

Embedded team is in-charge of connecting with PodX hardware and making it function. You will parse sensor data provided by the pod, filter out noise, implement safety procedures, and signal states to the pod so that it can move. Below are requirements for everything you will need to program the embedded chip. The micro controller used on the pod is **Arduino Uno**

## Embedded Data Packets

PodX provides all sorts of information in binary packets. These packets have a very specific structure and they need to be read the same way and write the same way. If a packet is wrongly structured, it will not be accepted by the pod. The binary packets have to be parsed by you and when you want to send data to the machine, you have to encode them. PodX communicates over I2C protocol and you can make your micro controller as a master and request and send data to Podâ€™s CPU. The slave address you need to connect to is `0x5A`. You can read about I2C protocol for Arduino here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Wire. 

**Sensor Packet**
The Sensor packet contains all the information about the sensor data that PodXâ€™s CPU sends. The packet specifications are as follows:

### Command Packet

Command Packets are to be used to send information to PodXâ€™s CPU. If the packet is not in the right format, it will be rejected and you can see the error message in the dashboard.

### Command States

States are used to control the movement of PodX on the Hyperloop track. PodX has a State Machine built into it. This means that for every given state only very specific states can be transitioned into. You will use **Command Packet** to communicate these states with the pod so that it can take you to your destination. Following are the states that are valid and will be accepted:

|    **State Name** |    **State ID** |
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| IDLE              | **0x00**        |
| READY             | **0x01**        |
| ACCEL             | **0x02**        |
| COAST             | **0x03**        |
| BRAKE             | **0x04**        |
| STOP              | **0x05**        |

- PodX will start in `IDLE` state and you have to switch the pod to `READY` state before the pod can send any data.
- `ACCEL`, and `BRAKE` are the states that are controlled by you. This will determine how the pod moves through the tube. You do not ever switch to `COAST` state and if you ever do it will be rejected.
  - `ACCEL` state can only be turned on when the pod is in `READY`
  - `COAST` state can only be turned on when the pod is in `ACCEL` state
  - `BRAKE` state can only be turned on when the pod is in `ACCEL` state
- When you brake the pod, the pod automatically transitions to `STOP` state after the velocity of the pod comes down to 0
- When you will request data from the pod, it will have the current state of the pod in the **Sensor Packet** you will receive.

### Error States

Error states are encoded in a 8 bit unsigned integer which you receive in every **Sensor Packet**. Each bit will either be 0 or 1 depending on whether the sensor/status associated is in an error state or working state. **0 means working state and 1 means error state**. Error States are as follows:

| **Bit Position**    | **Error State**       |
| ------------------- | --------------------- |
| First Bit           | Pod State ID          |
| Second Bit          | Acceleration Sensor 1 |
| Third Bit           | Acceleration Sensor 2 |
| Fourth Bit          | Acceleration Sensor 3 |
| Fifth Bit           | Temperature Sensor 1  |
| Sixth Bit           | Temperature Sensor 2  |
| Seventh Bit         | Temperature Sensor 3  |


### Information about Data
As you can see is that you are given acceleration data and the temperature data. Data is also very noisy and hence you need to smoothen it. You need to figure out velocity and distance so that you can make a correct decisions to change pod states and stop the pod before it crashes. Max distance before the pod has to stop is `30 KM`. You have to brake as close to this distance as possible.

# Communication and Dashboard

Communication and the Backend team has a big responsibility of connecting low level code with a more visual controllable dashboard. You obviously have to control the pod yourself and hence you will have a controls dashboard where you can do that. What your job is to make sure that dashboard can connect properly with the low level embedded code. You will be writing a server code on your laptop and arduino will be plugged into your machine. You will receive binary packets from arduino and you will have to parse these packets and make them readable and transferable and manageable (JSON, XML, etc). Then these packets will be sent to the dashboard so that they can show that data on the screen. **Your tasks are as follows:**

- Set up bi-directional communication with controls dashboard
  - Choose a suitable data format that you can use
  - Should be able to manually send commands (otherwise it must be autonomous)
- Create a log stash to dump data you receive from both Arduino and Dashboard
  - Do not shore binary data but rather the parsed data

## Dashboard 
* You will also be incharge of creating a dashboard that will run as a desktop application.
* You can use `Qt` or some other framework for doing that
* You have to show sensor data and show state transitioning.
* This does not have to be nice looking but rather functioning.
 
# Web Dashboard 
This team is incharge of creating a nice looking web dashboard to display sensor graphs and provide a way to send commands back to the communication server. You do not need to worry about creating a server because that will be done by the communications team. You can talk to them to figure out data format and what they are sending you. This is a truely open ended challenge and we want you to be creative. Just have following things in your dashboard:
* Data Graph for each type of data (acceleration, velocity, and distance)
* Buttons to change states (READY, ACEEL and BRAKE)
* Show current state of pod that the pod is in (IDLE, READY, ACCEL, BRAKE, and STOP)
